## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this analysis is to help Dana, a data journalist, collect UFO sightings data from a Javascript file, that includes date, city, state, country and type of sighting. A webpage will be created to display the data on a table and a filter functionality to allow users to narrow down their results.

## Results: 

Users have the ability to choose from five different filters: date, city, state, country and shape. Once the users input a criteria into the fields the table will automatically apply the filters to narrow down the results. 

The image below gives an example of the filters and the format that is required for each one of them and an example of the table that will be display next to the filters

## Summary: 
- One drawback of this new design is that the text boxes for the filters are not exactly aligned and they keep changing/moving depending on the screen size 
- One recommendation is to change the format of the filters instead of columns, all filters can be added above the table in one row to improve the formatting and avoid the size discrepancy 
- Second recommendation - improve the date filters by adding a calendar where users can select a start date and an end date. 
  -  Include a drop down menu on the other filters where users can select the options available instead of adding text. 
  -  Include the ability to sort by highest to smallest on the table to help users find what they need
